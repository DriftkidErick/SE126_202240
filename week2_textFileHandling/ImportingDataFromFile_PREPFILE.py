#Week 2 Day 1: Importing Data from a File

#YOU MUST IMPORT THE CSV LIBRARY IN ORDER FOR FILES TO BE ACCESSED

#CSV: Comma Separated Values
#RECORDS: rows of the file, different types of data all belonging together
#FIELDS: columns of the file, sets of data (all data in a column is the same "type" ie names, ages, salaries, email addresses, etc)

#BASE PROGRAM CODE-------------------------------------------------------------------

#STEP 1: import csv library so we can read the file
import csv

#you should ALWAYS have a total records var for your first few attempts at file reading
total_records = 0
#holds all salaries in file for total print at end
total_salaries = 0
#prnt header -- at the end, once everything else is running accurately
print("{0:10}\t{1:2}\t${2:7}".format("name", "age", "salary"))


#STEP 2: CONNNECT TO THE FILE LOCATION
#right-click the text/csv file in folder view --> "Properties" to find the file location
#these file locations are cAsE sEnSiTiVe & space/special character sensitive so DOUBLE CHECK THEM!
#flip all '\' to '/'
with open("week2_textFileHandling/example.csv") as csvfile:


    #notice ':' everything must be INDENTED now (until we're ready to "close" the file)

    #STEP 3: ALLOW THE FILE TO BE READ BY OUR PROGRAM
    file = csv.reader(csvfile)
    #now the file we have connected is known in the program as 'file'
    #file has several records, each record has several fields

    #below is a FOR loop
    #for loops are loops -- continually repeated sequence of code
    #they continue NOT based on a CONDITION but on a RANGE
    #range: '0 - 10', 'a - f'
    
    #STEP 4: ACTUALLY READ/PROCESS THE FILE DATA, ONE RECORD AT A TIME
    for rec in file:

        #notice the ':' everything in the for loop must be INDENTED
        #RANGE: for each record in the file, do the following
        #rec is a variable that is initialized the the for loop range
        #           on line 35
    
        total_records += 1 #SHORTHAND VERSION of: total_records = total_records + 1
        
                    
        #print entire record of file. we are seeing this as a LIST
        #print(rec) commented out
        #lists can hold multiple points of data at once
        #in order to specify a data point over another, we need to know its POSITION IN THE LIST

        #print only the names in the file -- specify position of data in lit
        #print(rec[0]) commented out

        name = rec[0]
        age = int(rec[1])
        salary = int(rec[2])  

        #add all salaries to total_salary -- REMEMBER: all data entering a Python program is treated as a STRING unless cast otherwise
        
        total_salaries += salary #total_salaries = total_salaries + int(rec[2])


        
        
        #add field width to ensure columns stay aligned
        print("{0:10}\t{1:2}\t${2:7,.2f}".format(name, age, salary))
 
#UNINDENTED MEANS NO LONGER CONNECTED TO FILE (no longer in the with open() block)
#print final values: total records processed and total salary of all employees in file

print("TOTAL RECORDS IN FILE  {0}".format(total_records))
print("TOTAL of ALL SALARIES: ${0:.2f}".format(total_salaries))
